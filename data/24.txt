Microsoft says its newest compact “small language model,” Phi-2, is bigger and better.The company has been working on training AI models on much smaller data sets comprised only of “textbook-quality” data, as part of its Phi models.
Microsoft says in a research blog that Phi-2, which is about twice as big as its predecessor, Phi 1.5, continues to perform on par or better than certain larger open-source Llama 2 models, including one with 13 billion parameters.
